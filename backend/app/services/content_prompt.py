## üß™ Quick Quiz

### Question 1
What does the following code output?
```cpp
int x = 5;
int* ptr = &x;
std::cout << *ptr << std::endl;
```

**A)** The address of x  
**B)** The value 5  
**C)** A pointer to x  
**D)** Undefined behavior  

**Answer**: B - The value 5. The `*` operator dereferences the pointer, accessing the value stored at the memory address.

### Question 2
Which statement correctly declares a pointer to an integer?

**A)** `int ptr = &x;`  
**B)** `int* ptr = x;`  
**C)** `int* ptr = &x;`  
**D)** `int &ptr = x;`  

**Answer**: C - `int* ptr = &x;` correctly declares a pointer to int and assigns it the address of x.
